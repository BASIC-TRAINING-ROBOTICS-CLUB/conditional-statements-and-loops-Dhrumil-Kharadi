Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. This makes it useful in various applications like error correction and digital systems.

Here's a simple explanation of converting a binary number to Gray code:

   Binary to Gray Code Conversion

1. Binary Number: This is the original binary number you want to convert.

2. Gray Code Formula: 
   - The most significant bit (MSB) of the Gray code is the same as the MSB of the binary number.
   - For the rest of the bits, each bit in the Gray code is obtained by XORing the current bit of the binary number with the previous bit.

Conversion Steps

1. Start with the binary number.
2. Write down the MSB of the binary number as the MSB of the Gray code.
3. For each subsequent bit: XOR the current bit of the binary number with the previous bit.

Example

Let's convert the binary number 1010 to Gray code:

1. Binary Number: 1010
2. MSB of Gray Code: The MSB of Gray code is the same as the MSB of binary, so it is 1.
3. Calculate the remaining bits:
   - Second bit: 1 XOR 0 = 1
   - Third bit: 0 XOR 1 = 1
   - Fourth bit: 1 XOR 0 = 1

   So, the Gray code for the binary number 1010 is 1111.
